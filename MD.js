// 1 Understanding the problem
// What is it asking you to do? whatâ€™s the input and the output?
// The goal is to create a user interface that displays a JS object and lets the user interact with it.

// 2 Write pseudocode
// Break problem down into key steps
// a) create html framework that can display the object
// b) create js file that contains object
// c) display the object on the website using DOM manipulation (look up looping through objects)
// d) build js that allows user to sort films by rating
// e) build js that allows user to add new film

// 3 Write JS for each step following the pseudocode
// console.log() to check code at each step

// 4 Refactor
// How can you change your code to make it more efficient? how might you solve the problem differently?
